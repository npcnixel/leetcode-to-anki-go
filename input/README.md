# Input Directory

Place your saved LeetCode HTML files in this directory.

## Important Notes:

- LeetCode uses GraphQL, which means the page content is dynamically loaded
- Standard browser "Save as" (Ctrl+S/Cmd+S) may not capture all necessary content
- For best results, use a browser extension like [SingleFile](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle) that captures the fully rendered page
- Make sure the saved HTML includes your solution code, problem description, and examples
